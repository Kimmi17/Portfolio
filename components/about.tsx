        After graduating with a degree in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Business Administration</span>, I decided
        to become a self-taught developer. I would say that is the decision I
        never regret in my life.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of addressing intricate issues and devising innovative
        solutions. I am familiar with multiple programming languages such as{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          Java, Javascript, Typescript, C#, Python.
        </span>{" "}
        . My core stack is{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          {" "}
          React, NextJS, Material UI, ShadCN, Tailwind, Redux, Jest, testing
          library â€¦
        </span>
        .For the back-end side, I can work well with ExpressJS, Prisma, Spring
        boot, hibernate combine with SQL or NoSQL database - for example: MySQL,
        PostgreSQL, MongoDB. I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am
        currently looking for a{" "}
